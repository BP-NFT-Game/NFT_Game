BrowserQuest
============

[BrowserQuest NFT Edition](https://bq.erdstall.dev) is a HTML5/JavaScript multiplayer game based on [the original](https://browserquest.herokuapp.com/) with NFT features. All weapons are NFTs with random properties.

The game has three major parts:

* the server side, which runs using Node.js
* the client side, which runs using javascript in your browser
* the database side, which runs using Redis

To deliver an NFT experience the game is powered by [Erdstall](https://erdstall.dev/)
* Metamask Browser Plugin connects a player to the Goerli blockchain
* An Erdstall Operator handles NFT transactions on a second layer network
* A metadata server stores in-game item NFT metadata, to be visible on-chain
* A marketplace is connected to the second layer network and enables management of aquired game NFTs

Erdstall Integration
---------------

This section aims to provide an overview of the integration of Erdstall functionality with the game's core. For implementation-specific details, refer to the corresponding well documented files.

### Client Side

**erdstallclientinterface.ts**

_erdstallclientinterface.ts_ exports the function getAccount(), which utilizes the detectEthereumProvider method from Metamask to let the user pick an account in their Metamask plugin and returns the corresponding wallet address.

This method is called in _gameclient.js_ when the client sends a player create or login function.

**gameclient.js**

The login and create requests were modified so that they no longer send an e-mail and user password for the player. Instead, only the player's metamask address (or in case of player creation also the desired name) is sent, which is used to identify the player's record in the database.

Gameclient.js was also extended with the function getNFTMetadata, which fetches NFT Metadata or sprite, and onNftReceived, which lets the _game.js_ register a callback for when a message with nft information (when players with NFTs spawn, when an NFT is picked up by some other player, when a player receives an NFT from transfer or when a mob drops an NFT item) is received.


**game.js**

game.js was extended with the nftSpriteCheck method, which checks if a sprite for an NFT has already been loaded and if not, calls the loadNFTSprite method and stores the request to avoid duplicate requests. This method is registered as the nft callback in _gameclient.js_ using its onNftReceived method. It is also called whenever the logged in player picks up an NFT item, as that does not trigger the onEquip function in _gameclient.js_, and in the method handling the server's welcome message, which also transmits the player's equipped NFT.

The loadNFTSprite method calls the _gameclient.js_'s method getNFTMetadata to fetch the sprite JSON for the requested NFT. The JSON is then used in _sprite.js_ to load the sprite from the server. Once an NFT sprite for the logged in player is loaded, the equipment_callback is called to update the item icon in the inventory.

The class also handles the chat messages/achievements shown when picking up an NFT.

**app.js**

App.js's initEquipmentIcons function was modified to load NFT icons when the player holds an NFT.

**sprite.js**

Extended with loadJSON to load sprites from a sprite JSON instead of the default item sprite path. The path to load the sprite from is determined using the .image_path_prefix JSON attribute concatenated with the sprite's scale and NFT ID (e.g. "/nfts/1/4124342.png");

**renderer.js**

The drawEntity method was altered so that weapons with an NFT context are drawn using the NFTs sprite. The drawing of entities holding NFT weapons carried out in the same method was modified similarly.

**item.js / entity.js**

The classes were extended with the nftKey-Attribute to store nft context.

**player.js**

The switchWeapon method was modified so that weapons are always switched (i.e. when looting) if the weapon is an NFT, disregarding the weapon's rank.

### Server Side

**erdstallserverinterface.ts**

This interfaces provides the interaction with the erdstall-ts-sdk. Using the init method, it initializes the Session object with the config.

It provides the following methods to be used in the BrowserQuest javascript files:

- mintNFT: Mints an NFT. This method is not to be called directly, as it does not ensure metadata generation. Instead, the static mintNFTItem method is used. The first mintNFT call after startup will attempt to mint on the NFT ID corresponding to the amount of NFTs stored in the database. If the mint operation fails due to the NFT ID already having been minted, it increments ID and tries again until it successfully mints an NFT. Subsequent mints will mint with this new, incremented ID.
- burnNFTs: Takes a list of NFT objects and burns them
- transferTo: Takes an NFT and a target recipient's address to transfer NFT to
- getNFTs: Optionally takes a wallet's address to retrieve NFTs in that wallet from. By default it fetches the NFTs held by the server
- registerCallbacks: registers a transferCallback and burnCallback function to be called on "receipt" and "exitproof" events

It also exports a global erdstallServer object to use these methods on and a static method mintNFTItem, which takes the desires item kind (e.g. "sword1"), mints an NFT, generates corresponding metadata and registers the NFT in the database.

**metadata.ts**

A metadata server class for generating metadata using getNewMetaData, storing metadata using registerNFT (which also generates corresponding sprite files and puts the metadata to the nerd marketplace) and fetching metadata and sprites either using a REST GET request or the getMetadata method. This class also encapsules the NFT _redis.js_ database interaction. It also defines and exports a global nftMetaServer object.

The server is mounted to the /metadata endpoint in _ws.js_.

**NFT.ts**

Class representing NFT objects.

**itemmeta.ts**

Class for facilitating BrowserQuest specific interaction (item kind and color) with generic NFTMetadata.

**main.js**

When the server is initialized, main.js calls the init method on the global _erdstallServer_ object after the redis database has been initialized. The setup has been adjusted to wait for erdstallServer to be done with initialization to then init the global _nftMetaServer_ before settings up the BrowserQuest specific rest. This ensures that both _erdstallServer_ and _nftMetaServer_ are fully operational prior to the game's server becoming responsive. After initialization all NFTs held by the server are burned too before any map is loaded to remove stale NFTs which cannot be picked up anymore.

**player.js**

The handling of _LOOT_ messages was modified so that if NFT items are looted by a player, the NFT is transferred from the server to the player using the _erdstallServer_'s transferTo function and to piggyback the nftKey on the equip message broadcasted to other players.

The class was also extended to handle _WEAPONSWITCH_ messages using its equipNextNFT method, which gets the player's NFTs using the _erdstallServer_'s getNFTs method and equips the next NFT item in the wallet, broadcasting the change to all players including the player's client.

It also features a setNftKey method for setting the nftKey attribute inherited by _entity.js_ and also updating database records.

**worldserver.js**

This class handles the world's logic and implements the transfer- and burn-callbacks (handleBurn and handleNFTOwnershipTransfer) registered on the _erdstallServer_.

These methods ensure that the NFTs are equipped by the correct players after burning and transferring. handleBurn also carries out the sprite deletion on the _nftMetaServer_. This is not handled in _erdstallServer_ directly to ensure that sprites are only deleted if no player carries an item with said sprite.

handleNFTOwnershipTransfer is also called when a user withdraws their NFTs from the Erdstall network.

It also implements the generateNftContext method responsible for NFT generation using the mintNFTItem method. This method is called when adding a static NFT item, adding an NFT item from a chest and when an NFT item is dropped by a mob.

When items are despawned, NFTs are burned using the _erdstallServer_'s burnNFTs method.

**redis.js**

The database class was extended with methods for storing, fetching and deleting NFT metadata as well as functions returning the player holding some specified NFT (used by _worldserver.js_ during transfer handling), retrieving the count of stored NFTs and storing the player's equipped NFT key.

The loadPlayer function was extensively modified to load players based on the stored crypto address instead of the username and ensure that the equipped NFT is still in the player's wallet when logging in.

createPlayer was also adjusted to check if the cryptoAddress is already used by some other player and respond with a login error, as well as minting a new NFT for the player upon initial login.

**item.js / entity.js**

The classes were extended with the nftKey-Attribute to store nft context.

**message.js**

Some messages were extended to include nftKey information.

How to get it going on Ubuntu
-----------------------------

Prerequisites:
* Node >= 16.13.1
* npm >= 8.3.0
* git
* Redis up and running
* blockchain (e.g. Ganache) up and running
* Erdstall funding operator up and running
* NERD marketplace up and running (optional)


Clone the git repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/BP-NFT-Game/NFT_Game.git
    $ cd NFT_game

Then install the Node.js dependencies by running:

    $ npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
    $ npm install -d
    
Compile Typescript files by running

    $ npm run postinstall
    
Before starting the BrowserQuest server, you must start Redis. In Windows, you can simply run `redis-server.exe` in your `redis\bin\release` directory.
Also make sure Operator, Blockchain are running

Then start the server by running:

    $ npm run start

The BrowserQuest server should start, showing output like this:

    $ node server/js/main.js
    This server can be customized by creating a configuration file named: ./server/config_local.json
    node_redis: Warning: Redis server does not require a password, but a password was supplied.

That means its working. If you are using the default Erdstall Operator network configuration and a Ganache blockchain no errors should occur except 
    
    Can't put Metadata to Nerd: http://127.0.0.1:8440/metadata/0xF73C1cdA5bD32E6693D3cB313Bd9B9338d96f184/7 : FetchError: request to http://127.0.0.1:8440/metadata/0xF73C1cdA5bD32E6693D3cB313Bd9B9338d96f184/7 failed, reason: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8440
    
if the marketplace was not found. All networking can be configured:

Configuring for development
---------------------------

We assume that for local development a Ganache blockchain (id 1337) is running localy, listening for remote procedure calls on port 8545, the Erdstall operator is running localy on 8401, and as Redis database is localy listening to port 6379 aswell. The game is setup to run on port 8000. Then the ts/config/serverConfig.json needs to contain

    "NetworkID": 1337,
    "NetworkName": "local",
    "erdOperatorUrl": "127.0.0.1:8401",
    "ethRpcUrl": "127.0.0.1:8545",
    "useSSL": false
    
Similarly the ts/config/clientConfig.json must contain atleast

    "NetworkID": 1337,
    "erdOperatorUrl":"localhost:8401",
    "useSSL": false
    
server/config.json must contain atleast

    "port": 8000,
    "nb_worlds": 1,
    "metrics_enabled": false,
    "use_one_port": true,
    "redis_port": 6379,
    "redis_host": "127.0.0.1",
    "database": "redis"
    
client/config/config_build.json-dist must contain atleast

    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 8000,
	"secure_transport": false

Over the parameters mnemonic, contract and derivation path in ts/config/serverConfig.json the cryptographic identity of the server is configurable. This is neccesary as the server is in possession of all NFTs that have not been collected by a player yet, ergo all weapons lying around.

To connect the NERD marketplace ts/config/serverConfig.json needs to feature the following paremeters:
* metaDataServer points to the game metadata endpoint, for local testing "127.0.0.1:8000" if the game runs on 8000
* NerdUrl point to the marketplace backend where the game is to store a copy of all metadata, "http://127.0.0.1:8440" for default local testing
* PictureHost points to the base URL where all NFT weapon showcase images are stored. This is the game server, so "http://localhost:8000" for local testing


After changing the config values you should run

    $ npm run postinstall
    
to verify all parameters are set for Erdstall.

After operator and blockchain are running, you can start the game. Make sure to wait a few seconds before you connect the frontend because the server needs some time to mint all static items (swords lying around). These need to be prepared before you login. Five seconds should suffice.


Configuring for deployment
---------------------------

Assumed is the use of an SSL certificate for deploying the game.
To enable TLS protected connections you need to set 

	"useSSL": true
	
in ts/config/clientConfig.json for a TLS browser client to game server connection, and in ts/config/serverConfig.json for a TLS gameserver to remote Erdstall Operator connection.
Also there is a hardcoded constant that controlls the game internal SSL settings. You can find

	const enable_secure_transport = false;

in client/js/app.js. To enable https and wss you need to change it to true. The game ignores most changes in the client/config/config_build.json-dist therefore changing this variable is required. When enable_secure_transport is set to true the client will ignore the port set in the config and connect to the default https (443) port. Make sure that a forwarding from 443 points to your game instance.

The port the game is to run on can be adjusted by 
	
	"port"
	
in server/config.json. 

Make sure to set the game host in client/config/config_build.json-dist, e.g.:

	"host": "bq.erdstall.dev"

Make sure to set the operator url accordingly in clientConfig.json and serverConfig.json. For a remote operator for example:

	"erdOperatorUrl": "operator.bq.erdstall.dev:8401"
	
Your Nerd Marketplace setup might look something like this if you run NERD together with BrowserQuest on a remote server:

	"metaDataServer": "https://bq.erdstall.dev:8000",
    	"NerdUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8440",
    	"PictureHost": "https://bq.erdstall.dev"
